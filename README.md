# To-do-list

## Description
Just like an ordinary todo list but utilising client side, server sided and database.
The client side is very simple and most of the interactive functionality is done through javascript, the fetch commands can also be found there too.
The server-side connects to Node/Express holding: CREATE, PATCH, POST, DELETE routes and finally the connection to the database is done through Seqelize ORM.
